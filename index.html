    <h2 id="what-is-operations-really">What is &ldquo;operations&rdquo;?</h2>
    <p>Operations is everywhere and nowhere. It's the behind-the-scenes and especially the in-between.</p>
    <p>If you work in any of the following areas, you may be an operator.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Administration</li>
      <li>Development and Grants Management</li>
      <li>Editorial, Design, and Production</li>
      <li>Events, Community, and Engagement</li>
      <li>Finance and Budgeting</li>
      <li>Information Technology</li>
      <li>Marketing, Communications, and Digital Media</li>
      <li>Office and Facilities Management</li>
      <li>Organizational Development</li>
      <li>Outreach and Partnerships</li>
      <li>People Ops and HR</li>
      <li>Programs and Strategy</li>
      <li>Project Management</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This list isn't conclusive. If what you do isn't on this list, join the group and suggest an addition.</p>

    <h2 id="why-join-a-community-of-practice">Why join a community of practice?</h2>
    <p>From <a href="https://m.orbital.nyc/why-you-should-join-a-community-of-practice-in-2017-a9c3d0b1326">Orbital's <em>Communities of Practice</em>:</a></p>
    <blockquote><p>Many organizations already have great internal processes for review and reflection — but sometimes you need to get outside of your own bubble. You may need access to new or alternate perspectives and strategies, or you may need a safe space to talk through challenges involving the workplace itself (how to navigate the personalities, processes and power dynamics, for example).</p>
    <p>One of the best things you can do is to is to find or build a community of practice — trusted groups of people outside of your company who have the same role as you — to share stories, best practices, lessons learned and challenges. The advice, support and alternate perspectives they provide you with gives you a deeper toolbox to turn to in your own decision making.</p>

    <h2 id="code-of-conduct">Code of conduct</h2>
    <p>We want this to be a fun, pleasant, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
    <h2 id="confidentiality-">Confidentiality:</h2>
    <p>We observe <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule">Chatham House Rule</a>, which means that participants can share what they've generally learned, as long as they don't reveal identifying information about the source.</p>
    <p>Don&#39;t quote things said here without the affirmative consent of the speaker(s).</p>
    <p><strong>Please be mindful that things you say here may at some point become public</strong>. While we expect members to honor the confidentiality of this space, we cannot guarantee that they will do so--nor can we guarantee that every member&#39;s login credentials and logged-in devices are secure. Please exercise caution and refrain from sharing sensitive information that could harm you or others if it became public.</p>
    <h2 id="logs-and-records-">Logs and Records:</h2>
    <p>We cannot prevent people from screencapping or otherwise logging this slack. We also can&#39;t guarantee that every member&#39;s login credentials and logged-in devices are secure. Files uploaded here can be downloaded by anyone with a login. Please exercise caution and refrain from sharing sensitive information that could harm you or others if it became public.</p>
    <h2 id="message-retention-">Message Retention:</h2>
    <p>Because this is a free slack account, we have restricted scrollback, but Slack--the company--retains complete logs of all channels and direct messages back to the creation of OPERATIONS—RESEARCH. Slack is a U.S. company and therefore subject to subpoenas from U.S. courts. Our logs may be subject to subpoena and could become public as part of legal proceedings.</p>
<h2 id="harassment-">Harassment:</h2>
    <p>Harassment includes:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion</li>
    <li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.</li>
    <li>Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names</li>
    <li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where they’re not appropriate</li>
    <li>Simulated physical contact (e.g. textual descriptions like “<em>hug</em>” or “<em>backrub</em>”) without consent or after a request to stop.</li>
    <li>Threats of violence</li>
    <li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm</li>
    <li>Deliberate intimidation</li>
    <li>Sustained disruption of discussion</li>
    <li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
    <li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease</li>
    <li>Publication of non-harassing private communication</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="reporting">Reporting:</h2>
    <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the admins. They&#39;ll respond as promptly as they can.</p>
    <p>We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.</p>
    <h2 id="consequences">Consequences:</h2>
    <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
    <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the admins may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from this slack and identifying the participant publicly as someone about whom we&#39;ve received complaints.</p>
